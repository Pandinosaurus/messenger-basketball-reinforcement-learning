# Messenger-basketball-reinforcement-learning
Using reinforcement learning to play basketball messenger with a robotic arm.

This project is based on: https://github.com/JoshuaRiddell/messenger-basketball-player

## Requirments

### Software
* ```Python 2.7```
* ```OpenCV```
* ```numpy```
* ```Pillow```
* ```pytesseract```

### Hardware
(This is what we used for the project)
* Arduino UNO
* Raspberry Pi 2
* 3 servos TowerPro SG90
* 5V-2A DC Power supply
* Raspberry Pi camera


## Modules

The project is based on 3 modules:
1. The computer vision (folder ```cv```) module that processes the video stream and extracts information from it. This information will be the input of the learning module.
2. The learning module (folder ```learning```), that takes the data extracted from the cv module as input and outputs the chosen action.
3. The inverse kinematics module (folder ```ik```), that takes an action as input and, via the inverse kinematics of the arm, computes the servo signals required to perform that action.

The way in which the modules relate to each other is illustrated below:

### CV module

### IK module

**This module is currently under development**

This module contains the **Arduino** code that:
1. Reads via serial port a set of ```x, y, z``` coordinates.
2. Computes the inverse kinematics of the robot and obtains the joint angles that result in the end effector reaching the desired position.
3. Moves the servos according to the obtained angles.
